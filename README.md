# _Wins!_ - a website with auctions

![screenshot of the landing site](img/winsScreenshot.png)

## Project Description

_Wins!_ is a project created to be used as an auction site. The landing site shows 100 auctions and enables user to search through them and check the details of each of those. However, only registered and logged in users are able to place theirs bids to the chosen auction(s). In addition, the user that is logged in, has a possibility to change their avatar, start a new auction (adding name of the object, its short description, tags, images and end-date) as well as edit or delete their auctions.

Since _Wins!_ is a school project that was handed in whinin a certain deadline, there is still many things that should be improved in the future, like adding the filter-function or a possibility to see more auctions than 100.

## _Wins!_ was built with:

- HTML;
- CSS + SCSS;
- JS;
- Bootstrap;
- Husky;
- Eslint;
- Babel;
- Vite;
- Jest;
